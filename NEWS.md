# hdflex 0.2.0
* Added the function `stsc()` to directly apply the STSC-algorithm from Adaemmer, Lehmann and Schuessler (2023). This function is faster and more memory efficient than subsequently applying `tvc()` and `dsc()` as it is now completely written in Rcpp.
* Fixed the package overview help file.
* Updated documentation
* Updated example

# hdflex 0.1.0
