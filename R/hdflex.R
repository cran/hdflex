#' hdflex: High-Dimensional Density Forecasts
#'
#' hdflex contains the forecasting algorithm STSC 
#' developed by Ad채mmer, Lehmann and Sch체ssler (2023) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4342487>.
#' STSC is a novel time series forecasting method designed to handle very large
#' sets of predictive signals, many of which are irrelevant or have only
#' short-lived predictive power.
